#Foreword
When I transformed myself back into a human being 5 years ago after a burnout, I discovered what was so unnatural about me. I tended to want to change the world. Yoga and Tantra have helped me clean up my inner life and not always blaming it for anything outside.  
Today I think I have found myself and know that we are able to recreate paradise for ourselves. I even had the luck to learn this in the middle of Berlin, which, however, was linked to a relationship with a great woman. You know, pink glasses, hormones and stuff.  
Today, however, I know that we can create our paradise independently of things in the outside, because we project these things outward.  
"As inside, so outside," is one of the hermetic laws. However, if we are unable to project a paradise in a city, then we have no choice but to move to the country. We also have the opportunity to invite exactly those people who, just like us, have awakened and want to live in and from nature.   
  
This book will reach the very people who have already undergone their transformation "BackToHuman" and those with whom this kind of enlightenment is imminent.  

Feel invited to take a short trip to paradise together with me. It does not matter whether you want to live exactly as I describe it or not. For me it is important that I motivate you to think about how paradise might look like for you personally.  
  
We are all creators and able to create the world for ourselves, as we would like. But I can also understand it if you want to stay in the city to reach even more people to help them get out of the system.  
  
I've been wanting to go away for a long time, but Berlin was captivating me. We were drumming in the Mauerpark together with people from all over the world. There was just the demo "Friday for Future", in which 270.000 people were on the streets to protect Pachamama (mother earth). But I also got to know people whom I would like to take to paradise.  

Currently I am on my trip to Portugal, sitting in a library in Bern (Switzerland), translating this book to the english language.
