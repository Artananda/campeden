	Today I was playing guitar in the streets for the very first time. Itâ€™s more amazing then playing drums. The guitar opens more hearts. And this also opens more pockets ðŸ˜‰ &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Hope the next time I can blog without stock photos. I have collected a lot of money on Facebook to buy a mobile phone with camera. Many thanks to all my friends for the donations.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Now itâ€™s time to drive to the beach and take a bath in the Atlantic. My busking in the morning makes me enough money to buy some diesel for my car.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
