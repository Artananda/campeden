	The first thing I noticed was a warm blanket around my shoulders. A police officer was talking to me.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	“Are you ok sir?”&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	I answered: “Where am I?”&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	“You are in…”&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	In heaven I thought.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	“You are in Zürich”&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	“Give these shoes to ny son please, I don’t need them anymore”, I said after I have seen them lying in front of me.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	“Don’t you want to dress yourself?”, the policeman asked,” you will die otherwise”&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	“Dying, I was already dead!”, I thought.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	“What has happened!? “, I asked.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	“An old couple found you sitting there.. nacked… meditating.”&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	“Please come into our car, otherwise you will die.”&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	&quot;Not again”, I though and stud up to enter the car.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	An ambulance brought me to the hospital.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	“I don’t think that I survived, sitting there for hours.” It was the end of January. And it was cold outside.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	“I have seen the light. Or was it just the light of a car?”&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	My wife entered the room in the hospital, “What do you think of scare me so much?“&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	“Oh god, why did you rescue me?”,I was joking to my self.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	The nurse turned around and was smiling at me. Did I said that loud?&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Ups&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	The doctor came and said: “I think you should make a therapy. You have to choose to go there as a volunteer or we will bring you there.”, she said.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Ok, not much possibilities.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	I was there for about 6 weeks, because I told them that I am on alcohol. I was not able to tell them the truth otherwise I feared I will never ever make it out if there.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	It took me about 3 additional months and I could escape to Denmark where my journey began.&lt;/br&gt;
