	After busking in Berlin Mauerpark for about 2 years now it was my first time playing solo without the help from my friends.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Got 20,- CHF for 2 hours‚Ä¶ Yeah they paid me doing what I really love to do.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	So playing congas for half an hour feeds me for one days. 
	Not too bad when we think of other people who have to work on bullshit 8 hours to feed them for one day.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	It doesn‚Äôt matter what you are working in Babylon. 
	If you are hairdresser, a software developer, a baker. 
	You have to work 8 hours a day no matter what you are doing.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	In freedom I had to do what I love for just half an hour to survive one day üòè
&lt;/p&gt;"
