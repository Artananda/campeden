	On my last day in Switzerland my new friend Philip invited me to a special place, high above a big 
	river where we where making a fire and where we were, doing a kind of workshop called Octopus.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Octopus comes from the word octo which means 8. 
	He told me to pick up 8 things on my way and then I had to put them on a floor to form a circle.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	For each of these eight things I had to choose a word which acts as a caption, kind of.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	The day before a rastafarian gave me a small turtle in Bern and told me to keep it and he also said 
	I should walk slowly. This turtle was my first item of 8. I gave the caption: Armour&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	The second thing was a red apple which was the only red one bet other green apples. 
	I gave it the caption: Abundance&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	These two things I was picking up before I even knew what to do.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	After Philipp told me what we were doing, he showed me the way his special place. 
	I asked him, if we can go another way. He answered yes, but that way we will need about 45 minutes more. 
	I answered, ‚ÄúOK, I want to go the other way‚Äù&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Walking 5 minutes in the wrong direction I found the rest of an old tree. 
	My third peace which I have titled: Evanescence&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	We walked back‚Ä¶&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Then I said‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI found something a couple of days ago. Can I use this too? ‚Äú&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	I have found the profession: Toucher&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	As a toucher you are able to help old people touching them and also having sexuality with them while 
	the health insurance will pay you doing this. I found this a nice work for people like me who have 
	studied sexological bodywork.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Then a stone came to my attention: Stone in the waves&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	The next thing I found was a stick, which I titled: Support&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Then I found a mushroom and remembered when I was afraid getting ill after eating mushrooms with 
	friends long ago. They have collected them in Spain and I didn‚Äôt believed that they know what 
	they were doing. I gave it the caption: Control&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Then I found a branch with the form of a fork. Title: Fork&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Then I had to put them in a circle and had to talk about each peace.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	I started with the turtle and remembered to walk slowly. 
	Standing with the back next to the abyss I was saying: ‚ÄúI should walk slowly otherwise I might 
	fall down the abyss accidently.‚Äù Nice outcome.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	With evanescence I had no problem because I died already.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	The apple has supported me all along the way. As a child I liked apple pie, we had two apple 
	trees in our garden, I have started fasting just drinking apple juice, I was listening to the 
	Beatles as a child and Beatles had there records recorded with Apple Records and I had almost 
	every product from apple starting with the shuttle mp3 player up to Mac Pro.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	The apple represents abundance because mother earth is providing us with enough to eat for everyone. 
	If we would stop eating animals.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	I found a conflict inside of me. I know that we have everything we need and we don‚Äôt have to ask 
	for money when we do something for someone. But I am not there yet, because I still have to pay 
	money for things I wanne have. Maybe I should stop to want things. And I should stop to buy 
	food and grow them on my own. But this is already my plan. Camp Eden.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	I said it‚Äôs my conflict, because I am still seeing this in my outside.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	The stone means rock in the surf. I don‚Äôt had one. My father was but then he stopped.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	I would like to be the rock in my family. I would like to be asked. I would like to teach others.

	Today I have asked Philip. Yesterday I asked you to remind me. So what was it. ‚ÄúForgive your parents.‚Äù, 
	he said. 
&lt;/p&gt;"

	So I immediately have made a family constellation. 
	And all of them were comming in form of a candle, bottle, cup etc. 
	I was able to embrace them and be thankful and also to ask for forgiveness. 
	I also invited my inner child and my son.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Tears in heaven. What a great tool ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüåà
