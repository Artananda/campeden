	Friday the 13th.&lt;/br&gt;
	No problem for me‚Ä¶it‚Äôs my lucky day‚Ä¶as every day.
	Found a restaurant with WiFi after searching for about an hour.
	You know, I am a programmer and programmers most often do have computers with them. So do I.
	Luckily my facebook account was not hacked (yet) and I could find some addresses I wanted to go to. 
	And google map helped me to find my way.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	That was my idea.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	But‚Ä¶unluckily I was driving about 120 km to far south and had to turn back.
	240 km to much‚Ä¶this is now destroying my budget.
	Yesterday I have also calculated how much money I have got left and guess what.
	I wanted to make my tank full of Diesel before I have to cross the border to Portugal
 	because in Portugal the Diesel is more expensive and my card was not accepted at the gas station 
	because‚Ä¶no money left. So I had to give away my last euros. In the calculation I forgot to count 
	the 40,- ‚Ç¨ cash I picked up after entering Spain a few days ago.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	I am now down to 5,- ‚Ç¨ and a few coins.
	No money problems any more.
	Life can begin üòâ &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Just imagine two weeks before x-mas and only 5,-‚Ç¨ left.
	Hard isn‚Äôt it.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Nevertheless, I arrived in the town where an old friend from school lives.
	You know what? 
&lt;/p&gt;"

	There were orange trees all over the area. Even on the main street there were orange trees. 
	If you are hungry you can just pick up an orange and eat it.&lt;/br&gt;
	I think I have already found the paradise ‚ù§&lt;/br&gt;
	I am only 16 km away from Portugal.
