	Yesterday I watched a video with Edward Snowden where he was talking about mobile phone.&lt;/br&gt;
	A big problem with them is, even when you think itâ€™s turned off then it permanently sends out information about where you currently are and what you are doing.&lt;/br&gt;
	Do you know that Google is collecting everything that you are doing on your phone?&lt;/br&gt;
	If you have not changed your settings at the google settings page then you can see which apps you have started when and how long you have used it and so on and so forth.&lt;/br&gt;
	I donâ€™t want to think about private photosâ€¦&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Google is spying at you.&lt;/br&gt;
	And not only google.&lt;/br&gt;
	Have you heard about the patriots act in USA?&lt;/br&gt;
	Also the government is spying at you over google and apple.&lt;/br&gt;
	They know when you are eating, shitting, masturbating and so on and so forth.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	As I have blogged before, someone in Madrid was showing me the problem, steeling my phone ðŸ˜‰ &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Because I have used the navigation app they know where I am and where I want to go.&lt;/br&gt;
	If they do not like what I am doing they could stop me on my way with a police control.&lt;/br&gt;
	They also know what I am searching for when I enter the search phrase in google.&lt;/br&gt;
	Itâ€™s not only the fact that they know that you are against there system when you are searching for alternatives.&lt;/br&gt;
	They can control everything.&lt;/br&gt;
	They can control what you are buying.&lt;/br&gt;
	They can control your religion.&lt;/br&gt;
	They can control what you are wearing.&lt;/br&gt;
	They can control your mind.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Yes of course there are also human beings working there and may be they are going to help us possibly. Butâ€¦these companies are there to make profit. Itâ€™s all about money.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	I remembered the last system message on my phone.&lt;/br&gt;
	It forces me to install the newest version of Android. To get rid of this message I had to find this tiny little press able text on the upper right corner to switch away the message. This is very annoying when you have got a phone call.&lt;/br&gt;
	But the worst thing about that is. They are fixing the so called security leaks.&lt;/br&gt;
	Do you know what exactly that means?&lt;/br&gt;
	Do you think they are spending millions of dollars for YOUR personal security?&lt;/br&gt;
	Dream on ðŸ™‚ &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	So what to do to overcome these problems?&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	First of allâ€¦only buy mobile phones which are running on top of Linux like Android and of course Linux.&lt;/br&gt;
	Then the phone should be rooted. That meansâ€¦that you are the admin of the phone and have the full control over it.&lt;/br&gt;
	Look for phones that already could have been rooted before.&lt;/br&gt;
	Then only install open source apps which you can trust.&lt;/br&gt;
	Use a VPN (virtual private network).&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	The whole story is also true for your desktop computer.&lt;/br&gt;
	Donâ€™t use Apple or Windows.&lt;/br&gt;
	Use Linux itâ€™s open source and free of charge and free of spyware.
&lt;/p&gt;"
