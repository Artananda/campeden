	Because of the fact that I met Maria and we are creating Camp Eden together, 
	my journey ends here. I not going to look for land else where.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
	
	As I stated that I have created Camp Eden together with Johanna, I am really doing,
	what I have written. Maria is named Maria Jo√£o which is a portuguese form of Johanna.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Today we have had a fullmoon ceremony to bless the land.
