	Did you ever found your soulmate?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Yesterday on the 1. Januar I met Maria.&lt;/br&gt;
	What a great start in the new year.&lt;/br&gt;
	Why do I know that she is a soulmate you might ask?&lt;/br&gt;
	Well, ...&lt;/br&gt;
	...you just know it when you see her or him.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	
&lt;/p&gt;"

	In my book Camp Eden I was writing about a garden full of fruit in Portugal next to Obidos.
	I send a request to the owner one week ago and he told me that he sold the land that very weekend.
	Telling this to Jose, a friend of mine, he told me that he knows a women in Obidos who just bought land 
	to create a community. Maybe it is the same garden.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
	He told me, where she is working. On New Year&#x27;s Eve I went to this shop and her colleage told me that 
	she will be working the next afternoon.&lt;/br&gt;
	So yesterday I met her...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We have got so much things in common. We have talked about the books we already read and we exchanged 
	book titles which are necessary to have a common base.
	She comes from a medicine background and she wants to create a place where people can rest and heal themselves.
	She also wants to grow food like Anastasia. This is very similar to my plans for Camp Eden.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I think we are going to create a place for LOVE and HEALING in the next years together.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I am sooo in LOVE with my life ‚ù§
&lt;/p&gt;"
