	Max was dancing all the way to Madrid, because there was a strong wind blowing all the time. 
	Max is very sensitive with wind. When I have seen a sign in Switzerland with the altitude of 
	1.000 meter. Now in the north of Spain there was a sign with 1.100 meters. 
	And there was also this sign with a snowflake on it. Snow? In Spain? Not yet, but it was coldâ€¦ 
	4 degrees only.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	In the evening I arrived in Madrid and one hour later someone has stolen my mobile phone.
	A man just asked me to open my door and was talking something I did not understood. 
	Yeah Spanisch. We wanted to show me something at the back of my car. There is something with 
	my bicycle he said.&lt;/br&gt;
	He got my attention even I was cooking.&lt;/br&gt;
	Meenwhile a second one was in my mobile home and steel my mobile phone.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Now I had to switch back to basics. Playing music on my own, reading a map and looking on my own 
	instead of making pictures ;-)&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	A sign from the universe? I think so.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Open your heart and find your way without a navi ;-)
