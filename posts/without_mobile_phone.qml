	Today I am without my mobile phone for more than two weeks.
	This is my first time without a smartphone since Steve Jobs has announced the iPhone back then.
	You know what...this has changed my life.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Today I woke up before 8 o&#x27;clock. I was able to see the sun finding it&#x27;s way throu the trees.
	I had enough time to do Yoga, drink a coffee and to meditate before going to play music in the streets, which I did at around 9:30. 
	The night before I went to bed at around 22:00.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Is&#x27;nt that amazing? I found back to my own rythm.
	Now I am thinking about to NOT by a smartphone anymore.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;So what will I miss?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Listening to music&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Listening to books&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Reading books&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Being reachable by WhatsApp, Telegram, SMS and telephone&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Having an alarm-clock&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hotspot for my computer&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Watching YouTube videos&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Making pictures&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Creating videos&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Checking Facebook&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Getting and sending emails&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Navigating while traveling&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Being ONLINE (On a line like a dog)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What did we do without all these nice functions?&lt;/br&gt;
	We had time!&lt;/br&gt;
	Time to give a hug&lt;/br&gt;
	Time to kiss&lt;/br&gt;
	Time to think&lt;/br&gt;
	Time to breath&lt;/br&gt;
	Time to make Yoga&lt;/br&gt;
	Time to talk to friends face to face&lt;/br&gt;
	Time to play games&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
	
	OK, a few functions I will miss. I like to read books and I don&#x27;t want to carry books in my mobile home.
	I like listening to music and books while falling asleep. 
	I also want to listen to language specific books while sleeping to learn Portugesh for example.
	I like to communicate async via Telegram and WhatsApp.
	And so on and so forth... 
	But, I think I don&#x27;t want to be on-line anymore.&lt;/br&gt;
	I think I will buy myself an old school telephone instead of a smartphone to be reachable and a tablet for all these usefull apps.&lt;/br&gt;
	Then I will check my mails and messages only once a day.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	FREEDOM ðŸ™‚
