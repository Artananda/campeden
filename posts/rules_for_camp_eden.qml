	There is a consensus for Rainbow gatherings...no alcohol, no drugs and no electricity.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

	So if I am at a gathering for the first time and it&#x27;s stated that there are no drugs and there is no alcohol 
	then I feel save to go there. Maybe I am addicted to alcohol, drugs or phones and I want to find a save spot 
	then I am wrong at a gathering where these rules do not count.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	In Poland there were many people smoking ganja, weed and you name it. This was already in the seed camp and 
	there was also a Pirate Camp where they had alcohol. 
	It was far away from the gathering but some guys where drinking alcohol and came to the gathering.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	I don&#x27;t wanne judge them. But I don&#x27;t wont people coming to Camp Eden disrespect this consensus.
	There is some work to be done. I want the community to be self sustained.
	A healing community where people are getting a feeling of being free. 
	Free of all attachments.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Also hierarchy is not healthy for a community. Hierarchy leads to competition and this leads to wars.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	So therefore I want some rules.&lt;/br&gt;
	I don&#x27;t know if there are agreements for RCL at all. Please point me towards them.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Three rules for Camp Eden I already know.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	&lt;strong&gt;Everything must happen with consens of the whole community living there (Rainbow).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;No money, no trade and no barter inside the community (UBUNTU).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;No hierarchy (Rainbow).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	And if the community is deciding that marihuana is a healing plant and no drug, then it&#x27;s welcome there.
	Maybe we will also find a consens that smoking marihunana (without tabacco) at the main fire is allowed. 
	It&#x27;s ok for me.
	Maybe we will grow marihuana like Anastasia as a healing plant. &lt;/br&gt;
	Fine.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	But there must be a consens. And this consens will be made by the people who are doing the seed camp.
	Which are normally those people who spend money to buy the land and are there to grow up Camp Eden.&lt;/br&gt;
