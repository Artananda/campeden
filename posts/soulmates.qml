	After meeting my first soulmate some years ago I was sure that there is one for everyone.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Now I have changed my mind.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	There are many ❤️&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	A girlfriend from Denmark told me once. 
	“I had a vision”, she said, a few days after I told her I want to travel to India and want to learn Yoga there. “I have seen you with your soulmate in an ashram.”&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Not only that she told me about my next lover, she also was able to let go of our relationship. 
	She is one of them.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Later, after deciding not to travel to India I went to Berlin to meet Joseph Kramer. 
	He is the founder of Sexological Bodywork and I was still in this education. 
	In Berlin I have decided to continue my education after meeting all these great people in Spirit, a place where I held my first workshops a few years later.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	A man from Oslo booked a session with me and after the session we were talking about Yoga and Natha-Yoga in Oslo. I told him that I know Natha from Malmö in Sweden and he responded that they are also in Berlin.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	The very next day I was at the opening ceremony for Tantra Yoga and I met this beautiful woman this day.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	After being a couple for about a few weeks I have realized that we met each other in an ashram ❤️&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	I finally found my soul mate.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Yesterday me and a good friend in Bern realized that there are additional soulmates all over.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	They are there to pull us into a specific direction and might leave right after being useful.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	There was a very nice woman who pulled me to Bern a couple of days ago. 
	After I have arrived she immediately fade out of my life. 
	A day later another woman was there for me. I met her 6 years ago. 
	She invited me for a beer on my birthday. 
	This day I met one of those people who read my first book “Die Kunst zu Leben und zu Lieben“ and he invited me into his house.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	I stood there for a couple of days. We had a great time. This meeting was very important for both of us.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Also the woman who brought us together faded away. Her job was done.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Some soulmates stay a while and some work like angels and fade away quickly after serving us.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	We have to let go…
