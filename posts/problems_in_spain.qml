	I just came across a big problem in Spain.&lt;/br&gt;
	I was talking about the UBUNTU philosophy to a friend in Spain.&lt;/br&gt;
	She has got land and grows fruit and vegetables.&lt;/br&gt;
	She told me that when she wants to sell her fruits and vegetables to the market for a lower price, to help the poor people, then she has to pay taxes as she was selling her stuff for a normal market price.&lt;/br&gt;
	So its not possible to overcome the dictatorship from the so called dark might.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	No no Spain is everything but a democracy.&lt;/br&gt;
	I personally don’t know about a country with real democracy.&lt;/br&gt;
	Do you?&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	In the morning I woke up with an idea to overcome this problem.&lt;/br&gt;
	Now I am planting the UBUNTU seed into the heads in Spain.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Just to remind what UBUNTU means.&lt;/br&gt;
	“I am because we are!”&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	If you have got land in Spain or Portugal. Grow food. Not animals. We only need animals to cuddle with. Ask the people there to help you to pickup the fruit. Don’t pay them money, give them food in exchange. So they don’t have to pay taxes.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Paying income taxes is slavery! Why should anybody else profit from your work?&lt;/br&gt;
	If they don’t pay social money to the poor people then don’t pay them at all!!!&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Take enough food for yourself to survive.&lt;/br&gt;
	Then sell the rest of the food to the market at normal rates.&lt;/br&gt;
	When someone is buying one kilo of food also give him or her 1 kilo of juice for example for free.&lt;/br&gt;
	This way you dictate the price and officially you only have to pay taxes for the half.&lt;/br&gt;
	Got the point?&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Viva la revolution UBUNTU ❤
