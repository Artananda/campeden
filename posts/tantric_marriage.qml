	I have seen her a couple of years ago in my Facebook group Tantra Dating.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	I met her personally last year in Poland in the seedcamp for an European rainbow gathering. 
	We got to know each other as fresh made tantra teachers.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Three days ago she was searching for a tantric teacher partner on Facebook.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	And yesterday we committed to work together as teammates.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	I had created a crowd funding campaign to buy a sailing yacht and I have pledged a tantric sailing trip. 
	And she advertised this campaign as WE give a sailing trip and workshops together ‚ù§Ô∏è&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	You know what that does mean to me? Yesterday I was alone on this trip and now we are a team of two. 
	Sooo powerful. Two tantric teachers with the same goals.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Please read my book Camp Eden where I also wrote about a woman, in the future, at my side. 
	I gave her the name Jo in my book!&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	You know what? Jo is this lovely tantra teacher I talked about before üòÄ&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	My dreams are going to become true ‚ù§Ô∏èüçÄüôè&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	At the moment she is in Guatemala. I also wrote about Guatemala in my book.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	I have finally found the KEY to manifest things. Writing a book. A book about the future.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Writing utopias is the most powerful thing to manifest things. 
	Btw..I got this technic from Bauchi. 
	He wrote the book 2020 die neue Erde. And this book has flashed me.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Jo‚Ä¶ You also know Bauchi, right?!&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	People if you are reading this‚Ä¶act‚Ä¶think about a good future‚Ä¶a future without governments, a future without borders, a future without illness, a future without hate, a future where everyone is loving each other, a future full of love, a future with good, healthy and intense sexuality.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	AND WRITE A BOOK ABOUT IT.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	If you want to support us. We have got a crowd funding campaign until end of year.
