	For the very first time I have seen the Atlantic now. I think the English Channel does not count as Atlantic.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	There is a very nice kite surf spot which I will try the next days. You can kite in the waves or if you want it a bit saver then you can do it in the Laguna.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	When I drove back to town with my bike it was raining very strong. But it‚Äôs December and it has got 18 degrees. So no problem at all üòâ &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	A few years ago I was looking for a spot like this. A place where I can go kite surfing the whole year and a town where I might work.&lt;/br&gt;
	Paradise found ‚ù§ &lt;/br&gt;
