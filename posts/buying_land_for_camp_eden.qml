	While scouting for land here in Portugal I came across a few opportunities to buy land.&lt;/br&gt;
	There was a fruit garden of 3.000 m2 for just 16.000,- € which pulled me here to Caldas da Rainha.
	I wrote in the book &quot;Camp Eden&quot; about that land. I was too late. Someone else bought it a couple of days before I arrived.&lt;/br&gt;
	Then there are two opportunities in Algarve wich I will regard the next days. 
	One land is 4 ha big with two houses for 160.000,- € and one is 11 ha for 150.000,- €.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; 

	We all know that hippies like myself and most of the member of the rainbow family of livin light 
	do not have soo much money, but I think we can make it anyways.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Here is the plan.&lt;/br&gt;
	I am personally have experienced some crowd funding campaigns. 
	When I was in university 7 years ago I have studies Human Computer Interaction Design and I had the plan to
	create software for non profit companies. I wanted to design software for theses companies and do the 
	crowd funding to get the money for the development. The software should be Open Source and free available 
	after.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
	
	I founded the company CrowdWare. The first project I wanted to fund was this company ;-)&lt;/br&gt;
	I have learned my lessions. First I wanted to create a pitch video. Because I have switched to Linux
	I was looking for software on Linux. Did not found something useful so I decided to create my own software.
	The idea of AnimationMaker was born.&lt;/br&gt;
	Then I wanted to fund this software project.&lt;/br&gt;
	No one gave a penny. &lt;/br&gt;
	Lessions learned but software developed anyways.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Then I needed to create a website for CrowdWare.&lt;/br&gt;
	Shall I host it on Wordpress or Drupal?&lt;/br&gt;
	I wanted a good website...a fast website...a website where I can do everything I could imagine.&lt;/br&gt;
	So the idea of FlatSiteBuilder was born. A content management system. Yes, it is CMS number 2467 or so.&lt;/br&gt;
	But it is Open Source, it is the defacto FASTES CMS on our planet and one is able to host it 
	for free on github.io for example.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	I also wanted to crowd fund this project.&lt;/br&gt;
	Also lessons learned.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	As you may have seen, I also wanted to fund a sailing yacht this way.&lt;/br&gt;
	Lessons learned ;-)&lt;/br&gt;
	Ok, I have stopped the campaign because I have lost contact to the owners, but I don&#x27;t think that I
	would be able to collect the whole amount of money.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	I think all above projects where kind of ego driven. Or in other words...all the benefits would have 
	come to my address.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	With the land it is completly different. First of all the benefits are going to the family. 
	Thousands of people may benefit from the land over the years.
	The whole family is able to help with donations and spreading the idea on gatherings and social media.
	And if you think that a hippy has no money then you are wrong.
	I personally know some dropouts like me who were working in Babylon before and have some money.
	Some of our family are still earning money in Babylon.
	I also have money in Switzerland which I will use. 
	It is money for the rent and they will payout when I want to buy a house. 
	But there are more ways to collect that money.
	Today I was busking. I was playing guitar in the street for one and a half hour and got 12,- €.
	Just imagine doing this for 10 days. 2 € I need for food and 10 € I can save.
	After 10 days I have got 100,- €.
	Now imagine that 1.500 sisters and brothers are doing something similar.
	100,- € x 1.500 = 150.000,- €. The first land will be payed in 10 days.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Are you in?&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	We can also point some friends to this idea. They might get an idea of living self sustained without 
	the need to work 40 hours a week. They might also drop in. And maybe some rich guys might give something
	like the people on the streets are giving us money not only to support us but to feel better.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Lets walk each other home &lt;3
