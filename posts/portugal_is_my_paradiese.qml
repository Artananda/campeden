	Yesterday I finally have arrived in Portugal. Because I had made a detour about 240 km in Spain a couple of days ago I was not able to reach Lisbon as my goal was. But I have now reached Caldas da Reinha. It‚Äôs close to the Atlantic coast and so beautiful.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	A few years ago I have deleted a core believe ‚ÄúI am to small‚Äù. In this psych-k session I was thinking. ‚ÄúIf I am able to manifest everything into my outside that I want to, then I will manifest only smaller people into my life.‚Äù And guess what. The people from Portugal are smaller than me. Feels good. (Tears are filling my eyes right now)&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	But it‚Äôs getting better. I woke up early at 8:00 and it was about 10 degrees in my mobile home. That‚Äôs kinda warm. And at the afternoon my car has 20 degrees. Not to bad. I am parking next to a park where I am able to walk barefoot. And in the morning I was participating a Thai Chi / Chi Gong group in the park. Nice warm-up for the day.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	A men from Australia who also has participated showed me the way to the tourist information centre after I have asked him for a library. Yes of course I have found it. That‚Äôs were I am writing this post right now. I have also asked the lady behind the counter where it is possible to play some music in the streets. You know, not even that my fuel tank is empty, also my fridge is empty and I only have 21,- ‚Ç¨ left for the rest of the year. So I need to make some money here.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	The lady told me that it‚Äôs possible and allowed to play music in the streets, but I need to register. So I went back to my car and picked up my passport. On the way I met two buskers playing guitar. Rainbow brothers of course. Feels good to have family near by.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	I don‚Äôt had to pay for the registration. Just filled out a form with my name and the number of my passport. An address I don‚Äôt need. I don‚Äôt have üòâ &lt;/br&gt;
	Now I have got a badge and I am officially a busker. This would be a nice idea for the busker in Mauerpark in Berlin.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Caldas da Rainha is the only town in Portugal where you can buy fresh fruits and vegetables every day on the market.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	And it‚Äôs even getting even cooler. There is kitesurf spot 10 km from here.&lt;/br&gt;
	And meanwhile I am listening to a music video on youtube where someone is saying: ‚ÄúBeing thankful is what connects our heart with the collective soul of the entire existence. Be thankful for the chance you get. Here and now. Paradise in our minds‚Äù&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	What an amazing experience. Fuck is this crazy. I love to live this wonderful life ‚ù§
