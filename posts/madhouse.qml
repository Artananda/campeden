	Even if I ask them to find a good place for a therapy for my alcohol addiction they brought me to madhouse.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Alcohol was not really my real problem, but it was a good reason to not tell them what was really going on with me. 
	To be sure I drank wine and beer and I wanted to get rid of it tree days before. 
	But you know, when you have got an addiction like alcohol, then the reason is not the alcohol. 
	Its more complicated than that. I also played World of Warcraft, an online role playing game. 
	This wasnâ€™t a problem neither. The real problem was my life. 
	I have caged myself into a marriage. 
	Of course I loved her once, but these days were long gone.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;


	If there is no sexuality, more than masturbation in your life, then life sucks.
	Monogamy sucks. 
	I really appreciate that there is still prostitution, otherwise I would have killed myself.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Have you read the story about Buddha? Something similar happened to me. 
	There were no doctors to heal me, the circumstances healed me. 
	If you see very ill people, than you feel relatively well.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	I could escape after 6 weeks.
	Do you know that they may keep you forever?
	They said my wife is able to pull me out or I have to ask someone official from the local community.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	Guess what? I told my wife that everything will change, when Iâ€™m out.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

	I was not lying. I left her.
&lt;/p&gt;

I also had to leave my son and my cat Sammy behind. But my son was 21 already and my catâ€¦ (feeling sad right now).&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

I also left my furniture in Switzerland, except of my desk.
I have moved to Hvide Sande in Denmark. A very good friend from Aarhus has rented a house for me.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

The first day I have arrived there, the caretaker told me that there is a very good spot for surfing about 100m away.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

I have reached paradise ðŸ™‚
