Living in Denmark was easy because I got enough money from Switzerland because I was unemployed.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

After the RAV in Switzerland invited me to attend a workshop I have answered them that it‚Äôs not easy for me to go to that workshop because I am currently in Denmark &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

So they invited me to Z√ºrich for a conversation. A man there asked me where I am living most of the time and I answered with Denmark.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

They canceled my unemployment money immediately and I had to leave Denmark because I was not able to pay the rent anymore. I was looking for a flat in Flensburg then, but I was not able to find a new house to live in, because the students where also looking for houses at that time and I was unemployed.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

So I was homeless.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

I was sleeping in my car at Flensburg train station. There was a toilet.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

I wanted to sell my stuff on ebay and a man from Turkey help me selling my stuff. He had an ebay shop in Flensburg. He also invited me to stay in his shop at night.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

There I was able to sell my stuff and I also found a mobile home Max.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

Finally this guy helped me out. Luckily I am not a racist üòè
